        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
                I finish my study as a mechanical engineer. While I use to do study I learned a little bit IT and programming, however it was linked to my subject study and it was limited.
                I have been introduced to the Code Natin and I found it a very good opportunity to learn about IT and coding and updated software also improve my IT knowledge.
                As might you know it's a three weeks course and I found it quite an impact course and even sometimes hard to catch!
                However I enjoyed it
