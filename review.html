                    HTML
            </h3>
            <p> 
                 is the main computer language used in the creation of websites. If planning on creating a site from scratch, it's important to know the basics. Various free online websites, such as W3Schools and HTMLGoodies, offer comprehensive information on how to get started with HTML. There are also HTML editors available that can streamline the process of creating Web pages with features like tag completion, but for basic coding you'll just need a program to create simple text files, such as Notepad, which is included in Windows. Professional packages such as Adobe Dreamweaver, CoffeeCup HTML Editor and Komodo IDE have additional features to speed up the coding and debugging process by highlighting coding errors and auto-completing often used tags.
                    Image Editors
                    You'll want eye-catching visuals on your site, which means you'll also need images sized to fit without slowing down bandwidth. 72 dpi (dots per inch) is the standard resolution for images displayed on the Internet, and based on whether you're using thumbnails or large files, size can range from 100 x 75 to 640 x 480 pixels. If your site is for design or imaging work, large file sizes can be helpful; otherwise, they may slow down page speed and deter customers. To resize images to fit, crop and convert within an image-editing application. Paint, a basic program included with Windows, allows you to do this with basic files; for more advanced file types, use an advanced photo editor such as Adobe Photoshop or Photoshop Elements. If you want to use buttons and logos on your site rather than text links, most pro software applications will allow you to create these as well; you can also achieve similar results using free software such as GIMP and Paint.net (links in Resources).
            </p>
            <h3>
                    Flash Creator
            </h3>
            <p>
                    
                    Adding Flash videos, animations and interactive presentations to your website will help you to enrich the experience for those who visit your site. Most Web browsers have built-in support for Flash, but to create these files you will need special software. Adobe Flash Professional allows the creation of very complex Flash products, at a price; free alternatives include software such as Synfig Studio, FlashDevelop and Giotto (links in Resources) that allow you to create Flash projects to integrate with your website. Note that too much Flash content will slow down loading on a user's connection, so you'll want to keep it minimal. Alternatively, the HTML5 standard, which is still under development as of mid-2012, allows you to add multimedia content like videos to your web pages while also being less resource-intensive.
                    File Transfer Protocol Tools
                    Once you have created your website on your own computer, you'll still need to have it uploaded to a Web hosting service. While most Web hosting providers has a Web-based interface for you to upload the files, it can be a slow and cumbersome process, especially if you are doing it in bulk. By using an FTP program, you can connect directly to the Web server that you are using to quickly and easily upload or download files. For lower cost, use free software such as Free FTP, FileZilla and Go FTP (links in Resources).
                    Analytics Tools
                    Creating a website is an ongoing process. Once you've created the basic design, you'll need to continually update and tweak it to keep content new and fresh to visitors. Analytics tools like Google Analytics and Open Web Analytics allow you to see what draws visitors to your site and where they are spending the most time. This in turn allows you to add more content that is interesting to your visitors, and tweak content that is not drawing the attention that it should.
                    Browsers
                    To make sure that your website works correctly and looks the way that you want it to, test it in different browsers. Internet Explorer is free with the Windows operating system. Other popular browsers such as Google Chrome, Firefox and Opera (links in Resources) are available for free online. After creating the HTML files for your website, use a browser to open them and double-check that all content displays correctly. For more accessibility, test your website on mobile devices like phones and tablets as well.

                CSS
        </h3>
        <p>
                    
                    Stands for "Cascading Style Sheet." Cascading style sheets are used to format the layout of Web pages. They can be used to define text styles, table sizes, and other aspects of Web pages that previously could only be defined in a page's HTML.
                    CSS helps Web developers create a uniform look across several pages of a Web site. Instead of defining the style of each table and each block of text within a page's HTML, commonly used styles need to be defined only once in a CSS document. Once the style is defined in cascading style sheet, it can be used by any page that references the CSS file. Plus, CSS makes it easy to change styles across several pages at once. For example, a Web developer may want to increase the default text size from 10pt to 12pt for fifty pages of a Web site. If the pages all reference the same style sheet, the text size only needs to be changed on the style sheet and all the pages will show the larger text.
                    While CSS is great for creating text styles, it is helpful for formatting other aspects of Web page layout as well. For example, CSS can be used to define the cell padding of table cells, the style, thickness, and color of a table's border, and the padding around images or other objects. CSS gives Web developers more exact control over how Web pages will look than HTML does. This is why most Web pages today incorporate cascading style sheets.[1]

                    Trello is a collaboration tool that organizes your projects into boards. In one glance, Trello tells you what's being worked on, who's working on what, and where something is in a process.
                    Imagine a white board, filled with lists of sticky notes, with each note as a task for you and your team. Now imagine that each of those sticky notes has photos, attachments from other data sources like BitBucket or Salesforce, documents, and a place to comment and collaborate with your teammates. Now imagine that you can take that whiteboard anywhere you go on your smartphone, and can access it from any computer through the web. That's Trello![2]

            <p>
                    
                    Each custom business software developer has a portfolio. You can check the projects they’ve worked on before coming to you. When looking at these projects, you have to evaluate whether they are similar to what you are looking for.
                    The second step is to contact the companies the software developer did the work for (if possible). Your goal is to find out how well the software works for the end user. Getting feedback from older clients is vital to understanding if the program works in the long run.

                    Large software development companies can offer excellent products, but you may not be satisfied with the price. Meanwhile, bigger companies may not always provide the personalised approach your business needs.
                    Small and mid-sized companies are ideal for businesses looking to order custom-made software with a reasonable budget. Usually, such companies provide attentive customer service and project management but may not have the capacity to complete large projects to tight deadlines.
                     While a small company is great for your budget, it may not have all the specialist development and project management competencies you need for your project. Also, if the number of developers and designers is limited, you may have to wait a long time to get your project done. Always ask the company representatives how many people they have available to work on your software.[3]

                            According to my experience and knowledge I have I believed is not a bad job so far, however, from my personal view the main concern about IT technology is safety!
                            I built this webpage on the  HTML base and i don't have any idea about IT security.
                            A part of safety i found my web page tidy with some useful information with pictures which help to better understanding of content, i tried to make it useful for everyone however i did not have that facility to make it easy access for disable people.
                            In my point of view my web page weakness is the web page needs to be more beautiful with some different boxes, toolbar and menu.
                            In this case i can not advertising if i could definitely i would put some images and links to advertising my job or the business which website is about it.
                            Probably I will probably change the web page background as I realised most of professional websites background are wihite or blank colour without any pattern.

                            Your visitors should come first, search engines second. Be human. Use descriptive navigation instead of generic “What We Do” text. Use words that your visitors would use and words that your visitors are searching for. It’s fewer clicks for the user and helps search engines indicate your relevance.

                            Everyone seems to have an opinion about whether or not you should use carousels on your website. But first, you should take a look at the data and context of which they are used and then make a decision on whether or not they are relevant to your users.
                            user interaction greatly decreases after the first slide. Not really shocking, but almost no one makes it to the fourth or fifth slide. If you do decide that carousels are needed on your site, keep it to three at most.
                            “The human brain is hard-wired to notice the onset of motion, which makes rotating banners especially distracting. We literally can not tune them out.”
                            Does that mean you shouldn’t have a carousel on your site? Not necessarily. Take into account the message, context and design.using a carousel for image galleries on a product detail page may be very useful to your visitors that are browsing on a mobile device. An auto-forwarding homepage slideshow with weak calls to action probably aren’t as useful.

                            If you have great clients that say great things about you, that’s amazing and it should be seen. The best way to do this is to scatter it throughout your site. If you use case studies or video testimonials, find a way to tuck them in there, or on product pages. The point is that no one is going to go looking for pages that praise you. You need to find ways to bring the good things folks are saying about you to the forefront.

                               People tend to get stuck in this mindset that no one scrolls below the fold. That’s not true and there are many studies that prove this.
                            Scrolling is the single most natural action users take on the internet. Yes, more attention is paid to things above the fold because it’s the first thing you see, but that doesn’t mean people don’t scroll and it doesn’t mean you have to stuff everything “above the fold.”
                            Put your most important messaging at the top and give your users a reason to scroll if needed. If you try to cram everything above the fold, you’re going to end up with a page that looks like this…
                            Unless you really want to purchase a hovercraft, would you want to stay on this page any longer than you have to? Probably not.

                            If you’re interested in collecting data and tracking conversions, you should be using a contact form. With every form, you should have a unique thank you page. This way you can set up goals in your analytics and track where your conversions are coming from.
                            In addition to tracking conversions, it’s easier for most users to fill out a contact form. If the user clicks on an email address on your website, it opens up whatever default email program is on your computer.
                            I use Gmail, but my default on my computer is Mail. Any time I have to click an email address it automatically opens up Mail. Then I have to copy and paste the email into my Gmail to send a message. Not the best user experience.
                            Note: there are ways to set your default email options, but for the average non-techy user it’s not as easy as it may seem.
                            Another user benefit is knowing that your message was received through an “auto response” email. When you send an email directly, you have no way of knowing if they received your message or not until the person responds.

                            HTML is very easy to learn and understand. For the one who is learning web development, HTML is the first and foremost language that the person will go through. It has simple tags and there is no hectic of case sensitivity in HTML. It simply has some tags that serve a specific purpose and that’s it. One can easily understand other’s code and can make changes in it if required as there is not a lot more to understand in it. Moreover, it does not throw any error or create any problem like other programming languages if the developer forgets to close the tags or make some mistakes in code.

                            One of the biggest advantages of HTML is that it is free of cost and there is no need to purchase specific software. One should not have to deal with different plugins required to work on any software as HTML does not require any plugins. So it is very cost effective as per business perspective as there is no cost of purchasing the license if the whole website is developed in HTML language.

So there is no need to worry about the website written in HTML for the browser support as the website would easily show up in all the browsers if the program keeps in mind to optimize the website for the different browsers. HTML provides an easy way to optimize the website in HTML according to browsers to the web developers.

It is quite easier to create SEO compliant websites using HTML than other programming languages. HTML websites are easier to read and accessed by web crawlers and hence reduces parsing time and the page load time of the website hence improving its performance.

Although HTML provides all the tags to the user to add everything in the webpage like a table, images, hyperlink, etc there were some drawbacks which were covered in the latest version of HTML, i.e. HTML5 which allows the user to insert a graphic, multimedia, semantic elements to develop powerful websites and improving UX consistently.[5]

                        5 Advantages of CSS Web Design
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                             
                            When you create a website for your business, time and money are likely to be major concerns. Luckily, there is a web design method that can help you save time and money while also improving your visitor's experience. Cascading Style Sheets, more commonly known as CSS, has fast become the preferred web design method for the benefits it offers web designers and website visitors alike.
                            CSS is a language used to detail the presentation of a web page's markup language (most commonly HTML or XHTML) – such as colors, fonts, and layout. One of its key benefits is the way it allows the separation of document content (written in HTML or a similar markup language) from document presentation (written in CSS).
                            If you already have a website that was designed using tables, you may be reluctant to make the switch to CSS, which will require some time and effort. However, the benefits of CSS are the same for new and old websites alike — so why wait? Here are 5 great reasons to ditch those pesky tables and turn your website into a CSS success story.
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        Consistency
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                            
                            By making one change to your website's CSS style sheet, you can automatically make it to every page of your website. The bigger your website, the more time CSS saves you. And not only does CSS saves time, it also ensures that your web pages have consistent styling throughout your site.
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        Bandwidth Reduction
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                            
                            When CSS separates your website's content from its design language, you dramatically reduce your file transfer size. Your CSS document will be stored externally, and will be accessed only once when a visitor requests your website. In contrast, when you create a website using tables, every page of your website will be accessed with each visit. Your reduced bandwidth needs will result in a faster load time and could cut your web hosting costs.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Search Engines
                </h3>
                <p>
                            
                            CSS is considered a clean coding technique, which means search engines won't have to struggle to "read" its content. Also, using CSS will leave your website with more content than code – and content is critical to your search engine success.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Browser Compatibility
                </h3>
                <p>
                            
                            The recent arrival of Google® Chrome is further evidence that today's Internet users have more browser options than ever before, which makes browser compatibility a major issue for your website. CSS stylesheets increase your website's adaptability and ensure that more visitors will be able to view your website in the way you intended.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Viewing Options
                </h3>
                <p>
                            
                            Another common web design concern is the increasing need to make websites available for different media. CSS can help you tackle this challenge by allowing the same markup page to be presented in different viewing styles —— for example, you may create a separate stylesheet for print or for a mobile device.
                            With so many advantages to offer, CSS is a wise choice for web design. If you're interested in making your website load faster, look better and rank higher, consider using CSS to create a new website or improve an existing website.[6]

                             <p>
                             The first step is to establish the project management team. The best project teams include stakeholders at all levels, from executives to those individuals at the front line. These individuals have the inside knowledge that will be critical to the success of technical experts from external organisations.
                             
                            The most important element about team composition is having a team that is effective working together. Collaboration and communication skills are two of the most critical personal skills demanded of all members. The ability and willingness to recognise and value the different roles and contributions of team members is essential. Every team needs problem solving, influence, process and compliance behaviours and values if it is to be successful. People possessing those different requirements for group success have very different behaviours and conflict can be a product of their interactions. Team development at the very start of the project should include training in communication skills, and the recognition and valuing of the different behaviours, values and personal skills needed for team success.
                             </p>

                             <p>

                             Accurate, useful, timely and credible communication is crucial to maintaining a cohesive team environment and achieving project success. All project information should be communicated consistently throughout each stage of the process so all team members are equally informed. Open sharing of information should be encouraged and a no surprises attitude must be adopted to create a trusting work environment. A variety of communication mediums should also be used. Team members will respond differently to written (email, text, memo etc), verbal (telephone, radio, face to face etc) methods of communication.
                             
                            Busy schedules and multiple projects can become obstacles to effective communication.   Recurrent face to face meetings must be scheduled to encourage ongoing discussions and ensure that deliverables are completed within project time frames.

                            Groups that plan together are typically more successful, therefore project leaders must realise the importance of collaborative planning and goal setting. This collaborative goal setting allows team members to achieve individual successes, while contributing to the overall project goals.
                             
                            Collaboration is the vehicle which:
                            Generates the most creative solutions
                            Gets the greatest membership support
                            Produces the greatest amount of personal growth
                            By matching each team member’s incentive to the overall goals, the entire team is motivated further to achieve success. It is also the project manager’s responsibility to manage the team’s development to ensure a cohesive integrated team is founded.

                            It should be noted that bringing a group of people together does not necessarily constitute a team, especially not an effective working team. One of the biggest mistakes made by project managers is not recognising this as a fact and then expecting their project team to hit the ground running from day one.
                             
                            Project leaders are challenged to facilitate relationships among people of very different backgrounds. However, they all share the common goal of the project. Conflict within projects can manifest itself in many different ways but a good project manager will intercept and take action when conflict occurs.  Despite the variables that might contribute to project challenges, by communicating team goals and expectations openly and effectively, these barriers can be overcome.

                            A recognition and reward scheme will help reinforce the importance of the key project deliverables and focus the team on the important aspects of the project. Completion of a project and the steps along the way can be very rewarding for team members. Outwardly celebrating these successes can be very motivating for the team. When project milestones are reached, they should be communicated to the project team members and stakeholders. Rewards can come in various forms. They should be established and communicated at the start of the project, as they may impact on other areas to the project, such as cost and time.
                             
                            The project management team needs to clearly understand the requirements and deliverables of the project as well as being aware of the organisation’s overall strategy, objectives and drivers. It is also essential for the project management team to understand the organisation,s professional and ethical requirements and subscribe to them and ensure that the project complies with them.[7]

Project planning is one of the pivotal elements in the project management process.
How each individual team interprets the goals to be achieved, is a direct representation of the level of clarity incorporated in the project plan. Especially when it comes to a test project, inaccurate project planning can have a serious implication on the test execution of the system under test and on the overall quality of the product as a whole. 
<h3>
    In this test project planning tutorial, we will learn
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        The overall project planning process in testing projects
    </li>
    <li>
        Discussion on certain specific planning elements such as resource management, coordination and reporting techniques
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Test planning process
</h3>

Here below, is a walk-through of the various stages of the test planning process, discussed concisely.
<h3>
    Stage #1: Review and analyze the requirements 
</h3>
<p>

This is the first step for any project and plays a very important role in any testing project.
While trying to analyze the requirements, the test team has to identify and hence determine what items have to be tested. These items are heavily based on how the end user will consume the system and hence has to be measurable, detailed and meaningful.
The items or features that are identified generally describe what the particular software or product intends to do; characterized as functional requirements. There can also be some non-functional requirements identified such as performance or end to end software components' interaction.
The people who're aware of the business goal and can suitably define the requirements needed are generally part of this activity. The requirements are then documented and circulated for reviews. All the review comments and feedback must be incorporated to drive the document to the final sign-off.
</p>
<h3>
    Stage #2: Scope of testing
</h3>
<p>



The scope of testing is generally an extension of the requirement analysis phase and mostly considered as a single activity, since they go hand in hand. Once the requirements are out, the test team determines what items are to be tested and what not.
This activity should also target to determine what areas of testing are covered by what teams.
For example one team is dedicated for FVT (Function Verification Test) and SVT (System Verification Test) will have a completely different scope for testing, and globalization may or may not be performed by FVT and so on.
Also if the test project requires automation, the feasibility of that is also evaluated here. Having a clear scope defined will prove invaluable to the management to clearly figure what has been tested and which team has covered the testing effort. 
</p>
<h3>
    Stage #3: Design the test strategy according to the scope 
</h3>
<p>

The test team after gathering the requirements and identifying the scope of testing will then put out a high-level document called the test strategy document, defining the testing approach to achieve the test objectives.
A test strategy document is not meant to be updated too often.
On a high level, the content of the test strategy document will have the scope and objective of the testing, the approach, roles and responsibilities of individual test teams, tools identified for testing, the metrics identified, risks and mitigation plans, reporting and tracking mechanisms, etc.
</p>
<h3>
    Stage #4: Identify the required tools needed for testing and management 
</h3>
<p>



Based on whether automation is possible and whether CLI (Command Line Interface) or GUI automation is targeted, the corresponding tools need to be identified. 
There also have to be tools identified for test management which will help in creating and assigning tasks, tracking the test progress, identifying roadblocks and generating reports indicating progress. We will discuss this more in detail in the second part of the tutorial. 
</p>
<h3>
    Stage #5: Estimate the test effort and team 
</h3>
<p>



Correct effort estimation can prevent any time delays and dynamically enable the re-balancing of resources as required.
The primary factors that would influence this activity are the size of the team, the skills within the team, the attitude of the team and the schedule.
It is mandatory to have the effort estimations reviewed by the team to keep in line with these factors which is directly proportional to their interest levels. 
Stage #6: Define test schedule 
Once you have the testable items that have been broken down into logical line items, the sizing estimate complete for the specified piece of work, a measurable test schedule has to be defined based on all these and the assigned testers.
</p>
<h3>
    Stage #7: Enablement plan
</h3>
<p>


Whether it's a new project that has to be tested or an enhancement of a previously existing system, the test team must be trained not only technically but also with respect to the overall test process being followed.
</p>
<h3>
   Stage #8: Determine and procure the test environment 
</h3>
<p>

Identify the needed infrastructure required for testing the system and initiate all the requests to acquire the needed hardware, software and networking pieces to support the testing.
This is a crucial element in the planning phase as this will govern the stability of the test environment, which will have a direct impact on the defects produced.
</p>
<h3>
   Stage #9: Identify test metrics 
</h3>
 <p>
Test metrics are generally the quantified method to derive the quality of the product or system.
At the beginning of any project, these measurable units need to be level-set which aid in determining whether there are any opportunities for improvement. Generally, for quality audit purposes, the metrics are direct indicators of the product and process quality.
</p>
<h3>
    Stage #10: Create the software test plan, reviews and approved 
</h3>
<p>



A test plan document is more test-centric and explains “what to test”, “when to test”, “how to test” and “who will test” which is determined from technical documentation such as use case documents, High-level designs, etc.
Till now, we discussed the different stages in Project planning.
While each stage can be a tutorial in itself, this portion of the article aims to bring out the less commonly talked about planning tasks. These tasks if not given suitable fore-thought, will have an adverse effect on the test team and hence the product.
Let's take a look at these tasks, their importance and tips to constantly keep improving them in order to manage the QA project effectively.[9]
